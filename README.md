DAY 1
1)Bubble sort
2)make a simple linked list with all the operations like measure length, remove as well as add element at end and start, remove and add element at particular location show error when needed
3)simple queue implementation with add , remove and length operation. (n sized queue)
4)stack implementation with push , pop, peek operation.(n sized stack)

1)insertion sort
2)make a simple doubly linked list with all the operations like measure length,print, remove as well as add element at end and start, remove and add element at particular location show error when needed
3)simple circular queue implementation with add , remove,print and length operation. (n sized queue and dynamic sized both)
4)stack implementation with push , pop, peek, print,print while vacating operation.(dynamic size stack)
5) linear and binary search(very easy)
