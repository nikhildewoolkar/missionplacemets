Tell me about your self.

My name is Abhijit Shirke. I am 20 years old.
I have completed a Bachelor of Computer Science with a CGPA of 7.85 from SVPM College, Pune. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Applications (MCA) from SPIT, Mumbai. 
During my Bachelor's degree, I developed two projects: a bank management system and a blood bank system. For the front-end, I utilized Java with AWT, Swing, and ActionListener, while PostgreSQL was employed for the backend of the bank management system, and MySQL for the blood bank system. 
Furthermore, I have obtained certifications in C, C++, Core Java, and Python.
Strengths:
1. Collaborative: I enjoy working in a group setting. During my graduation project, which required teamwork among three members, I took on a leadership role to ensure effective collaboration and project completion.
2. Loyal and trustworthy: People I work with and my teacher, friends always say I'm really loyal and trustworthy. I always try to be honest in everything I do, both at work and in my personal life.
